# Kerberos

## What is Kerberos?
```
Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that works on the basis of tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. It works based on the client-server model and is implemented in Windows Active Directory environments as the default authentication mechanism using the NTLM challenge/response protocol for authentication.
```

## Enumeration
```
Basic enumeration starts out with an nmap scan. Nmap is a relatively complex utility that has been refined over the years to detect what ports are open on a device, what services are running, and even detect what operating system is running. It's important to note that not all services may be deteted correctly and not enumerated to it's fullest potential. Despite nmap being an overly complex utility, it cannot enumerate everything.

## Domain privilege escalation
```
The first step in domain privilege escalation is to enumerate the domain. This can be done with the following command:
```
Get-NetDomainSID
```
This command will return the domain name, the domain SID, and the domain controllers. The domain SID is important because it can be used to enumerate the domain users and groups.
