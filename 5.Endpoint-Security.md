## Logging 
```
The Windows Event Logs are not text files that can be viewed using a text editor. However, the raw data can be translated into XML using the Windows API. The events in these log files are stored in a proprietary binary format with a .evt or .evtx extension. The log files with the .evtx file extension typically reside in C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs.
```
`There are three main ways of accessing these event logs within a Windows system:`
- Event Viewer (GUI-based application)
- Wevtutil.exe (command-line tool)
- Get-WinEvent (PowerShell cmdlet)

## Sysmon
```
Sysmon is a tool that is used to monitor and log events on Windows and it is mostly used by enterprises as part of their monitoring and logging solutions.
```

## Osquery
```
Osquery is an open-source tool that Security Analysts, Incident Responders, and Threat Hunters can query an endpoint (or multiple endpoints) using SQL syntax. Osquery is also multiplatform.
