# OWASP Top 10 – 2021

## Broken Access Control
```Broken access control allows attackers to bypass authorization, allowing them to view sensitive data or perform tasks they aren’t supposed to.
In this room we learn that the url of a bank displays the ID of the customer plaintext, if we were to change to another id lets say, we could easily see and/or use the data of another customer. This is called Insecure Direct Object Reference or IDOR which refers to an access control vulnerability where you can access resources you wouldn't ordinarily be able to see.
