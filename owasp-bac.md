# OWASP Broken Access Control

## Broken Access Control
```
Access control is a security mechanism used to control which users or systems are allowed to access a particular resource or system. Access control is implemented in computer systems to ensure that only authorized users have access to resources, such as files, directories, databases, and web pages. The primary goal of access control is to protect sensitive data and ensure that it is only accessible to those who are authorized to access it.
```

## Role Based Access Control
```
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. By defining roles in an organization and assigning access rights to these roles, you can control what actions a user can perform on a system.
