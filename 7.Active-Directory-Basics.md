# Active Directory Basics

## What is Active Directory?
```
Active Directory is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services. Initially, Active Directory was only in charge of centralized domain management. Starting with Windows Server 2008, however, Active Directory became an umbrella title for a broad range of directory-based identity-related services.

## Managing users and groups
```
Active Directory provides a centralised control for network administration and security. Server computers configured with this software are known as domain controllers. Active Directory provides support for locating and working with objects across these boundaries. Object types can be users, computers, groups, printers, shared folders, security policies, etc. Active Directory organizes objects in a hierarchical structure, top-down, that resembles a tree. This allows easy navigation through the objects using the hierarchical pathnames. A similar model can be seen in the Unix/Linux world, where files are arranged in a hierarchical directory structure.
```

## Initial domain flaws
```
The initial design of Active Directory in Windows 2000 did not include much in the way of access control enforcement within the directory. This was a deliberate design decision, meant to reduce the load on access control mechanisms (ACLs) that would otherwise be consulted on every access to the directory. Instead, the designers relied on access control enforcement at the endpoints of the directory, specifically the Kerberos authentication package and the NTLM authentication protocol. This design decision has been criticized as a step backwards from the capabilities of the earlier X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP), which was designed to support access control at the directory level.

## LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning
```
LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) are two name resolution services that are enabled by default on Windows clients and servers. LLMNR was (and still is) used for name resolution on local networks if DNS name resolution fails, while NBT-NS is used for NetBIOS name resolution. Both services are enabled by default on Windows 7 and above, as well as Windows Server 2008 and above. LLMNR and NBT-NS poisoning is a common attack vector used by penetration testers during internal penetration tests. The attack involves spoofing responses to LLMNR and/or NBT-NS name resolution requests, which are broadcasted by a target machine looking to resolve the hostname of a system it is trying to communicate with. The attack is very similar to ARP spoofing, with the difference being that the target system does not need to communicate with the attacker â€“ only the attacker needs to send spoofed responses to the target.
```

## Trees, Forests and Trusts
```
Active Directory is a directory service that stores information about objects on a network and makes this information available to users and network administrators. Active Directory gives network users access to permitted resources anywhere on the network using a single logon process. It provides network administrators with an intuitive, hierarchical view of the network and a single point of administration for all network objects.
