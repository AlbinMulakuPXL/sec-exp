# Passwords and Hashes

## SAM
```
Security Accounts Manager (SAM) is a database file in the Microsoft Windows operating system (OS) that contains usernames and passwords.
```

## NTDS.dit
```
NTDS.dit is the main Active Directory database file. It contains all objects in the domain: user accounts, groups, computers, etc.
```

## Hashes
```
A hash is a one-way function that takes a variable length sequence of bytes and converts it to a fixed length sequence. Hash functions are related to (and often confused with) checksums, check digits, fingerprints, lossy compression, randomization functions, error-correcting codes, and ciphers. 
```

## Pass the Hash
```
Pass the hash (PtH) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password. This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash. 
```

## Detection/Mitigation
```
- Use a strong password policy
- Use a password manager
- Use a password blacklist
- Use a password lockout policy
- Use a password expiration policy
- Use a password rotation policy
- Use a password strength meter
```
