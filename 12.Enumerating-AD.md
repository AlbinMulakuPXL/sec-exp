# Enumerating Active Directory

## Enumerating AD
```
Once we have that first set of AD credentials and the means to authenticate with them on the network, a whole new world of possibilities opens up! We can start enumerating various details about the AD setup and structure with authenticated access, even super low-privileged access.


During a red team engagement, this will usually lead to us being able to perform some form of privilege escalation or lateral movement to gain additional access until we have sufficient privileges to execute and reach our goals. In most cases, enumeration and exploitation are heavily entwined. Once an attack path shown by the enumeration phase has been exploited, enumeration is again performed from this new privileged position. This is repeated until the goal is reached.
```

## Credential Injection
```
In order to perform enumeration, we need to be able to authenticate to the network. This can be done in a number of ways, but the most common is to use the credentials we have already obtained. This is done by injecting the credentials into the current PowerShell session. 

Credential injection in Active Directory refers to the unauthorized acquisition and use of credentials within the Active Directory (AD) environment. Active Directory is a directory service developed by Microsoft that is widely used for managing and organizing network resources, including user accounts, groups, computers, and other devices. Credential injection poses a significant security threat as it allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and resources.
