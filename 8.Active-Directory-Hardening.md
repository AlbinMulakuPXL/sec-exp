# Active Directory Hardening

## SMB Signing
```
SMB stands for Server Message Block. Generally, Microsoft-based networks utilise this protocol for file and print communication. Moreover, it allows secure transmission over the network. Configuring SMB signing through group policy is crucial to detect Man in the Middle (MiTM) attacks that may result in modification of SMB traffic in transit. SMB signing ensures the integrity of data for both client and server. All supported Windows versions have an SMB packet signing option.
```

## LDAP Signing
```
Light Weight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) enables locating and authenticating resources on the network. Hackers may introduce replay or MiTM attacks to launch custom LDAP requests. Therefore, LDAP signing is a Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) property that only accepts signed LDAP requests and ignores other requests (plain-text or non-SSL). 
```

## Implementing Least Privilege
```
The principle means giving any users account or processes only those privileges which are essentially vital to perform its intended functions. For example, a user account for the sole purpose of creating backups does not need to install software: hence, it has rights only to run backup and backup-related applications. Any other privileges, such as installing new software, are blocked.
