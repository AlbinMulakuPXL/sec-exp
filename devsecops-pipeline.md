## SaST vs DaST 
```
Static application security testing (SAST) is used to secure software by reviewing the source code of the software to identify sources of vulnerabilities.
```
`SaST Tools`
- Roslyn
- SonarQube
- Snyk

```
Dynamic application security testing (DAST) is a non functional testing process where one can assess an application using certain techniques and the end result of such testing process covers security weaknesses and vulnerabilities present in an application. This testing process can be carried out either in manual way or by using automated tools.
```
`DaST Tools`
- Owasp ZAP
- Acunetix
