## SIEM vs SOAR
```
SIEMs provide valuable insight into cyber threats by aggregating and analyzing security data 
from various sources.
SOARs prioritize and respond to security incidents effectively 
by leveraging machine learning-driven automation and orchestration capabilities.
```

## What is SIEM
```
A technology that supports threat detection, compliance and security incident management through 
the collection and analysis (both near real-time and historical) of security events, 
as well as a wide variety of other event and contextual data sources.
```

## What is SOAR
```
The combination of technologies that enable organizations to collect inputs monitored by the security operations team.

## Splunk Lab
```
Splunk is a powerful SIEM solution that provides the ability to search and explore machine data. 
Search Processing Language (SPL) is used to make the search more effective. 
It comprises various functions and commands used together to form complex yet effective search queries to get optimized results.

This room will dive deep into some key fundamentals of searching capability, like chaining SPL queries to construct simple to complex queries.

We use the Search & Reporting App as the UI for splunk so we can input queries to search for data.
